# Copying this template

The template is based on a package called `your_package`. Due to the nature of python and python packaging, this name is spread througout the codebase. 
Don't forget to change the following: 

* `pyproject.toml` file - This file contains the meta-data for your project. Please check 
carefully and replace all references to `your_package` with your project name. 
* `ci/<platform>/*`: several scripts to perform certain tasks. These scripts sometimes reference the package name and need to be changed to kee the script working.
